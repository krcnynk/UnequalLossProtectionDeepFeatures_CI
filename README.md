# DFTS2
Unequal Loss Protection of Deep Features Simulation (Grad-FEC)

Implemented a modified Grad-CAM, and trained a proxy model to mimic it. This project can simulate various loss patterns and detect importance of features so that it can assign FEC packets for these features to protect them for Cloud Edge based transmission  and computing.
